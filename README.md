The N-Queens chess puzzle is the problem of placing ``n`` queens on an ``n x n`` chessboard such that no two attack each other. This puzzle was solved using two techniques: Local (Hill-Climbing) Search and a Genetic Algorithm. Local Search finds an optimal solution by systematically evaluating and moving the worst-placed piece to a better square. The genetic algorithm runs several problem instances in parallel and uses elements of randomness to discover a solution.  Solved up to n = 19
